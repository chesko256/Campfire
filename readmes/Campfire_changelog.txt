Complete Camping System

Change Log

===================================================
Release 1.5 (11/21/2015)

Features

    You can now put out a campfire without a frost spell. Simply select "Put Out" from the campfire menu.
    Destroying a campfire will now put it out first, and return any unspent fuel to you.
    There is now a "Get Up" option when sitting near campfires, similar to tents.
    (SKSE Req) You can now activate your campfire while sitting near it by pressing the jump key, similar to tents.

Changes

    Included PapyrusUtil updated to 3.1.
    You can no longer "Use" a campfire when sitting near it, or access "Skills".
    The player's camera state (first or third person view) before using a tent or campfire is re-applied after exiting it.
    The option for harvesting deadwood now always appears, but selecting it without an appropriate axe in your inventory displays an error, in order to make it clear to new players how to obtain deadwood.
    Added back-end support for a future feature in Frostfall.

Bug Fixes

    Fixed an issue where the ingredient for a fur plate was a sweet roll when using Complete Crafting Overhaul.
    Fixed an issue where the cooking pot was difficult to select.
    Fixed an issue where ruined books were not being subtracted from the player's inventory when creating campfires from them.
    Fixed an issue where the player or followers could become stuck if they destroyed or picked up the object they were using, if that object was furniture (campfires, tents, etc).
    If a placed object doesn't get disabled and deleted on the first try when packing something up, we now try one more time and log a warning in the Papyrus log.


Release 1.4 (11/10/2015)

Changes for Players

    Cleaned Pelts are now Fur Plates, and is the same Fur Plate used by Complete Crafting Overhaul, Immersive Armors, and other mods. If any of these compatible mods are installed, they will share this crafting component.

    A wide number of back-end changes were made to ensure a very deep level of compatibility with Complete Crafting Overhaul and Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul (thanks, Kryptopyr!)

        Experience should no longer be granted when crafting certain survival equipment.
        Cloaks can now only be enchanted with elemental Resist enchantments.

Changes for Modders

    Purchasing a perk using the Campfire Perk System (in any skill tree) generates a new Campfire_CampfirePerkPurchased SKSE mod event.
    A number of injected records were added to support increased compatibility. Will be documented soon.

Bug Fixes

    Hotkeys should now be correctly blocked when in a crafting menu.
    Fixed a critical bug in the equipment processing code.
    Fixed an issue where Frostfall would think that there was a fire nearby any time the player was near a tent.
    Removed an unnecessary check in the head equipment section of the equipment monitor script.
    Removed unnecessary debug message when exiting a cell that has a tent in it.


Release 1.3 (9/27/2015)

Changes
    You can now sit and lie down in a tent in first-person when using Enhanced Camera.

    Changed the idle animation for enchanting supplies. These should be much better for Enhanced Camera / Immersive First Person users.

    Using campfires now puts the camera in 3rd person view when using Enhanced Camera in order to avoid a nausea-inducing head wobble. Setting bForceFirstPersonCamera=1 and bForceFirstPersonSitting=1 in SKSE_EnhancedCamera.ini will keep the camera in first-person view, but the effect is not pleasant.

    Made the script update speed when sitting or laying in a tent or sitting near a campfire less aggressive.

Bug Fixes
    When catching a large leather tent on fire, the flames and rubble no longer spawn under the ground.

    Set some missing parameters on the fires that spawn when catching objects on fire.


Release 1.2 (9/27/2015)

Changes
    Frostfall 3.0 is now correctly detected by Campfire.

    Loading Frostfall 2.6 or below will now cause Campfire to display an error message that will not go away until you exit the game and disable it.

Bug Fixes
    You can no longer use Build Campfire, Instincts, Harvest Wood, or Create Item while mounted and in several other cases (transformed, swimming, etc) when using a hotkey. Doing so caused errors that would require the player to exit the game.


Release 1.1.1 (9/25/2015)
Features
    You can now select a campfire and choose "Place Cooking Pot", which will automatically place your cooking pot for you near your campfire.

Changes
    Objects in the world that glow when using Survival Skill: Instincts should now get stuck glowing much less frequently.

Bug Fixes
    Fixed an issue with Campfire_OnObjectPlaced and Campfire_OnObjectRemoved events not setting the value of abIsTent correctly.

Release 1.1 (9/10/2015)
Features

    Survival Skill: Instincts - A new vision ability that allows you to detect many things in your surroundings. Detect moving creatures, the dead (and undead), and items that can be used as tinder in your campfire. This feature requires SKSE 1.7.3+ and is optional.

    Campfire Perk System - A new stand-alone perk system has been introduced and is accessible from any lit campfire you have built. Campfire introduces the Camping skill, and offers 5 perks with 13 ranks total. Earn perks by successfully lighting campfires Frostfall, Last Seed, and Art of the Catch will introduce their own perk trees into this system as well, providing a new growth path for players.  As this new system is completely stand-alone, it will not conflict with any existing perk overhaul mod.

    Settings Profiles - Your Campfire mod settings can now be automatically saved to a Profile. Settings Profiles are written to a file, and persist across saves, loads, characters, and new games. If enabled, any settings changes you make are automatically saved to your current Profile, and your last used Profile will be loaded any time you load your game or start a new one, ensuring that you spend less time configuring mods and more time playing the game. There are 10 Profile slots to switch between, and can be renamed.
        This feature requires SkyUI and SKSE 1.7.3+ and is optional. This feature can be disabled.
        Renaming profiles requires SkyUI 5.1+. SkyUI 4+ is supported, but you will not be able to rename profiles.

    New Craftable: Rough Bedding - A simple pelt and hay for the player to sleep on. Requires only a single Cleaned Pelt, so the player can acquire this almost immediately.  Has no lantern and affords no shelter in Frostfall or Last Seed, however.

    "Talk To..." Option - When sitting or laying down in a tent or sitting near a fire, you can easily choose one of up to 3 tracked followers to talk to, even if they're too far away to select. Especially helpful for Immersive First Person View users since targeting followers in that mode can sometimes be very difficult.

    Frostfall 3.0 and Last Seed Support - The stage has been set for this version of Campfire to support the next iteration of Frostfall, and Last Seed, when they are complete. 


Changes

    The minimum SKSE version has been increased to 1.7.3+. SKSE continues to be optional. But if you do use it, Campfire will expect this version or higher or certain features (Instincts, Settings Profiles) will not work.
    
    Different kinds of tinder now have different chances of successfully lighting the fire. (Example: Dwarven Oil has a 100% chance in clear weather, but Canis Root might only have 55% chance. This means that, yes, there is now a chance of failing to light the fire.) Lighting a fire in bad weather is much more difficult than clear weather. The chance each tinder has of lighting the fire successfully is displayed when building the campfire. If the campfire fails to be lit, the tinder is lost, but any fuel will remain ready for you to try again.

    Tinder items are now used directly as part of the campfire building process and are no longer a separate item. This should reduce the number of steps necessary to build a fire.

    If a fire is put out because of a frost spell or shout, it must be rebuilt and relit using new tinder. You will be given any unused fuel items when you interact with the campfire again.
        Pro tip: When camping a short time, it may make sense to put your fire out and reclaim the fuel before destroying it. It might mean time less searching for fuel later.

    Camping equipment should now de-spawn when picked up much faster.

    Removed the Dense Stone item and removed its use from all recipes. Stone Hatchets and Arrows can be crafted solely from wood components.

    Stone Hatchets no longer break when used to harvest deadwood; instead, they gather much less deadwood per harvest than a Woodcutter's Axe.

    Added a Tanning Rack recipe that uses Deadwood.

    Added a Walking Stick recipe that uses Deadwood.

    Gathering Branches now has a sound effect.

    The sound effect volume when gathering Deadwood has been reduced.

    The size of the Small Leather Tent and Small Fur Tent have been increased slightly (20%) in order to be more accommodating to NPCs.

    The sitting distance between the player and NPCs at a campfire has been tightened. The player now always sits at the same location around a campfire. (For use with Immersive First Person View to talk to followers while seated around the campfire.)


Bug Fixes

    Camping equipment items that were intended to be permanent in the world now spawn as persistent. (Tents, etc) This should mean that your tents should not risk disappearing if you leave them in a cell for a very long time and the cell resets.

    Camping equipment should now be completely deleted immediately when picked up. Previously, it might have taken a very long time for objects to be deleted from the system after pickup.

    Implemented a work-around for a case where using an ENB meant that the screen never truly fades to black in some cases, leading to being able to see certain things that were never intended to be visible.

    Improved the laying down position of the player and their spouse (if present).

    Fixed an issue where the bed roll of a small leather tent would clip out of the back of the tent.

    Fixed a bug when placing a new campfire very close to the location of an old destroyed campfire.

    Fixed a number of Papyrus log errors that could occur on start-up citing missing files. An error referencing FrostUtil will continue to appear if Frostfall 3.0 is not installed and is harmless and only appears once on start-up.

    Followers activated when using a bed roll or sitting near a fire no longer immediately stand up when talked to.


Compatibility

    Requiem: Fixed a glowing NPC effect issue when using Campfire's Follower Tracking feature.

    Equipping Overhaul: Added an option in the MCM to enable a work-around to get rid of visual duplicate weapons when inside a tent. This is not official support from Campfire or Equipping Overhaul, and is disabled by default.

Translation

    All strings now live either in the SkyUI MCM Translation files (skyrim/Data/Interface/Translations/Campfire_*.txt) or in the plug-in itself. There is a new CampfireStrings quest that holds some specific strings as script properties that can be modified for translation purposes if necessary.

Notes

    For those of you that have asked me about better Inigo support: I have heard that 2.1 (which is supposed to be released soon) works great with Campfire. Please look for that soon from Smartbluecat!
