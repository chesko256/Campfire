License Agreement

===================================================

This license is dated 3/2/2016 and supercedes any other licenses or permissions, written or oral, in any form.

=== TL;DR ===

	* You can use Frostfall for personal use.

	* You can’t copy and distribute it on other websites or include it in a package.

	* You can make translations of Frostfall, and you don’t have to ask for permission; you already have permission. You can’t translate and redistribute the entire mod; you can only create and distribute the files necessary for the translation. This includes the Frostfall_<LANGUAGE>.txt files used by SkyUI’s Mod Configuration Menu. Please see the Quest "FrostfallStrings", attached script "_Frost_Strings" for string properties that should also be translated. There should be no strings in need of translation in any script files.

	* You can create Frostfall-dependent mods and distribute them. You don’t need permission to do this; you already have permission. As above, you can’t redistribute the entire mod with your mod.

	* You can create mods that use the FrostUtil API. You can’t include FrostUtil API code or the rest of Frostfall in your own mod; you must require that your users install Frostfall in order to take advantage of the things offered by FrostUtil.
	
	* If you have a question, just contact me at chesko.tesmod@gmail.com or the contact information at the bottom of the agreement.

	* Thank you for using Frostfall and respecting my wishes for how I intend for it to be used and distributed. You’re awesome.
